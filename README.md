# Naive Bayes Purchase Data Analysis

## Overview
This project applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze and predict purchasing behavior based on historical purchase data. The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s particularly suited for classification tasks.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/naive-bayes-purchase-data.git
cd naive-bayes-purchase-data
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the raw data for analysis.
    ```bash
    python src/data_preprocessing.py
    ```
2. **Model Training**: Train the Naive Bayes model on the processed data.
    ```bash
    python src/model_training.py
    ```
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
    ```bash
    python src/model_evaluation.py
    ```

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of historical purchase records, including features such as:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Product details (category, price, etc.)
- Transaction details (purchase date, quantity, etc.)

Ensure that the data is placed in the `data/raw/` directory. The preprocessing script will handle the rest.

## Model
The Naive Bayes classifier is implemented using the `scikit-learn` library. Key steps include:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting data into training and test sets
- Training the Naive Bayes model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results
The results of the model evaluation are saved in the `results/` directory. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are available in the `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
